I'm a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering with the Department of Computing of Sheffield Hallam University since September 2019.

I received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK (2011), a MSc in Systems and Computing (2007), and a BSc in Computer Science (2005), from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

I'm actively involved in R&D in the area of Software Engineering and its interplay with Information Security, exploring topics like Self-adaptive Software Systems, Service-orientation and Business Process, Secure by design, Digital Identity Management and Access Control. I have been involved in a number of [projects](/projects) related to Smart Cities and Information Security, applying the above mentioned topics to the areas of Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and DevOps.

Previously (2012 - 2019), at the Metropole Digital Institute (IMD) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil, I was the Head (Sep 2017 to Sep 2019, and Aug 2015 to Jan 2016) and deputy Head (Sep 2013 to Aug 2015) of the Post-graduate Programme in Software Engineering (PPgSW) of IMD, now Post-graduate Programme in Information Technology (PPgTI).
