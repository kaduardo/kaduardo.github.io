I'm a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering with the Department of Computing of Sheffield Hallam University since September 2019.

I received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK (2011), a MSc in Systems and Computing (2007), and a BSc in Computer Science (2005), from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

I'm actively involved in R&D in the area of Software Engineering and its interplay with Information Security, exploring topics like Self-adaptive Software Systems, Service-orientation and Business Process, Secure by design, Digital Identity Management and Access Control. I have been involved in a number of [projects](/projects) related to Smart Cities and Information Security, applying the above mentioned topics to the areas of Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and DevOps.

My current research interests are organised in three strands:

- Software Engineering for development of Service-Oriented systems: This line of research looks at software development process for (micro-)service-oriented systems, including aspects of DevOps, Technical Debt and the use of Business Processes for guiding the services definition.
- Digital Identity Management and Access Control: This line of research looks at the employment of Federated Identity Management and Access Control techniques in different domains, and its use for dealing with insider threats through the means of self-protection techniques.
- Cloud-based infrastructure for supporting IoT applications: This line of research looks at the development/deployment/operation of supporting infrastructure (e.g., [FIware](https://www.fiware.org/)) for IoT applications.

If you are interesting in pursuing a PhD under my supervision, fell free to contact me. Sheffield Hallam University offers a number of competitive scholarships to new PhD students. For more information check <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/research/degrees">SHU Research Degrees</a> Web page.

Previously (2012 - 2019), at the Metropole Digital Institute (IMD) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil, he was the Head (Sep 2017 to Sep 2019, and Aug 2015 to Jan 2016) and deputy Head (Sep 2013 to Aug 2015) of the Post-graduate Program in Software Engineering (PPgSW) of IMD, now Post-graduate Program in Information Technology (PPgTI).
