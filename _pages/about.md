I'm a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering with the Department of Computing of Sheffield Hallam University since September 2019.

I received a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Kent at Canterbury, UK (2011), a MSc in Systems and Computing (2007), and a BSc in Computer Science (2005), from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

I'm actively involved in R&D in the area of Software Engineering and its interplay with Information Security, exploring topics like Self-adaptive Software Systems, Service-orientation and Business Process, Secure by design, Digital Identity Management and Access Control.

I've been involved in a number of projects related to Smart Cities and information security, applying the above mentioned topics to the areas of Cloud Computing, Internet of Things and DevOps.

I was one of the leaders of the cloud computing for science (CNC) work group of the Brazilian National Research and Education Network (RNP), which deployed a large scale cloud storage platform throughout Brazil and resulted in a spin-off company.

Previously (2012 - 2019), at the Metropole Digital Institute (IMD) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), Brazil, he was the Head (Sep 2017 to Sep 2019, and Aug 2015 to Jan 2016) and deputy Head (Sep 2013 to Aug 2015) of the Post-graduate Program in Software Engineering (PPgSW) of IMD, now Post-graduate Program in Information Technology (PPgTI).
