The [Smart Metropolis](https://smartmetropolis.imd.ufrn.br/?page_id=361) was a 5-years project aimed at the development of information and communication technology for human and smart cities.

I was the leader of the Infrastructure Work Package, responsible for overseeing the aspects related to cloud infrastructure deployment and operation, information security and access control, and ensuring the project adopted a ‘security by design’ approach to its systems from the outset.
